# Fake News Detection

This **Fake News Detection** project is designed to identify and classify fake news using supervised machine learning models. By analyzing the text features of news articles, the model can learn patterns that differentiate real from fake news, helping combat misinformation. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data, extract relevant features, and train supervised models to accurately detect fake news.

### Project Overview

With the rise of misinformation, automated fake news detection has become increasingly essential. This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on the text content. The primary goal is to build a reliable classifier capable of identifying fake news with high accuracy, using a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.

### Features

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and prepares raw text data for model training.
   - Removes stop words, punctuation, and applies tokenization and stemming.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Uses NLP-based feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to capture meaningful information from text.

3. **Supervised Model Training**:
   - Implements and trains supervised models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for classification.
   - Compares model performances and tunes hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

4. **Real-time Prediction**:
   - Accepts new articles as input and provides predictions on whether the news is real or fake.

### System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `nltk`
  - `spacy` (for advanced NLP preprocessing)
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (for data visualization)

#### Hardware Requirements
- 8GB+ RAM (recommended for training larger models)
- Multi-core CPU for faster data processing

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLP Resources**:
   - Download NLTK resources like stop words.
   - If using SpaCy, download the required language model:
     ```bash
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```

4. **Prepare Data**:
   - Add your dataset (`data.csv`) to the `/data` directory in the following format:
     - `title`: The title of the news article.
     - `text`: The main text content of the article.
     - `label`: The label, where `1` = fake news and `0` = real news.

5. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run `preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract features using `feature_extraction.py` which uses TF-IDF or word embeddings (selectable in code).

3. **Train Models**:
   - Train your model by running `train_model.py`, which includes multiple classifiers.
   - Tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

4. **Evaluate Model**:
   - Use `evaluate.py` to assess model performance on test data.
   - Visualize results and confusion matrix with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

5. **Real-time Prediction**:
   - To predict whether a news article is real or fake, run `predict.py` and input the article’s title and text.

### Methodology

The **Fake News Detection** project uses a pipeline approach with the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use a labeled dataset with both real and fake news articles.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data by removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
   - Apply stemming or lemmatization for standardizing text.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
   - Experiment with other vectorization methods if needed (e.g., Count Vectorizer).

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train multiple supervised machine learning models on extracted features.
   - Models used include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Optimize hyperparameters for each model using cross-validation.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models on test data to identify the best-performing model.
   - Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best model to a script that can take real-time news articles as input and classify them.

### Considerations and Limitations

- **Data Quality**:
  - The accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the quality and size of the dataset used. Ensure the dataset is diverse and balanced.

- **Bias and Ethical Implications**:
  - Models may unintentionally learn biases from the dataset, leading to misclassification. It’s crucial to continuously evaluate and improve model fairness.

- **Generalizability**:
  - The model may perform differently when applied to different sources of news. Additional training data and regular updates are essential for maintaining accuracy.

- **Detection Limitations**:
  - Fake news detection is challenging, as sophisticated fake news may evade detection. Combining this model with other methods, such as source credibility checks, is recommended for better reliability.
